To open the game in edit mode to see scripts and code and everything, install the latest godot stable (version 4.3 at the moment), then open Godot.
Once Godot is open, make sure the game zip file is extracted, then in Godot click "Import Existing Project".
Find where the folder is and open it, it should say something like "Found valid project at path" then you can import it and open/edit it.
Once open, if it asks for a Wakatime API key, just leave it empty and click submit, and it should go away.
If there's any problems then you can message me.
