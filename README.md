# Knight-Platformer-Game
Simple game made in Godot, it is mainly just so I can learn how Godot works. The game currently only has 1 level, and i'm not sure if i'll be updating it any more than this

# Usage
If you would like to just play the game, download the .exe file and run it, that's all you will need

Otherwise, if you would like to see the code and look at the game inside of Godot, you can download the folder which will have everything inside.

Once you have the folder installed, you can simply go into Godot and click "import existing project" and find the folder.

If you open it in Godot and it asks for a Wakatime API key, simply leave it blank and click submit and it should go away.

# Controls

Move left - "A" or "Left Arrow"

Move right - "D" or "Right Arrow"

Jump - "W" or "Space" or "Up Arrow"

Pause Menu - "Esc"

Roll - "Shift"

# Disclaimer/Credits
The only asset I made myself was the jump orb, everything else is from here: 
https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle

I suck at making assets and was more focused on the coding side so I used these assets to make a game to learn how Godot works.
